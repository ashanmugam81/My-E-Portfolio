									<h2>Unit 2: Advanced Persistent Threats: Applying the Cyber Kill Chain Model to a Case Study</h2>
									
									<p>This week we will revisit the Cyber Kill Chain model proposed by Lockheed Martin (Hutchins et al, 2011) and apply it to a modern case study - the solar winds exploit (Temple-Raston, 2021) to explore if the well-known Cyber Kill Chain model is still as applicable for the analysis of modern Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).
                        </ul></p>

<u><b><p>In this unit we shall:</u></b><p>
<p><li>Discuss the impact of APTs and review the Cyber Kill Chain model.</p>

									<h2> Unit 3: Vulnerability Assessments </h2>

<p>This week we will review the different approaches to vulnerability assessments from paper-based processes such as Cyber Essentials, through a variety of vulnerability assessment approaches, to Crest-based and certified Penetration Tests. The lecturecast focuses on a general vulnerability assessment approach that can be used to create the basic audit document. This document should be used as the basis for more in-depth penetration tests.</p>

<u><b><p>Scanning Activity:</u></b></p>
<p>Using the website(s) assigned to my in Unit 1, I carried out the following exercises and answer the questions listed below.</p>

<h2>Assessment</h2>

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>I was able to find the right method, tools, and procedures to manage and/or fix the security threats and holes in network systems that I had found and analysed these security threats and holes. The book “ TCP/IP Tutorial and Technical Overview” author by Praziale,L. et all(2016) provided a deep insight of TCP/IP knowledge. The book was very detailed provided\sI completed the scanning activity for the webserver “ehr-online.co.uk” and uploaded the results to eportfolio.
Baseline Analysis and Plan has been prepared and submitted, during the preparation I was introduced to new tools like Kali and revisited STRIDE, DRED and PCIDSS standards.</p>

<h2>Unit 4: Breach Analysis and Mitigation</h2>
                   							
<p>This week we will use the techniques covered so far to review and evaluate security breaches and formulate responses to typical attacks. We will also review the suite of tools contained in the Kali Linux distribution that are focused on security assessments and testing.</p>

<u><b><p>In this unit we shall:</u></b><p>
<p><li>Review a number of typical security breaches.</p>
<p><li>Discuss typical mitigations to stated attacks.</p>
<p><li>Evaluate some of the tools include in the Kali Linux software distribution.</p>

<u><b><p>Collaborative Discussion 2: The Pros and cons of logging – The impact of log4jForum</p></b></u>

<b><p><a href=https://github.com/ashanmugam81/My-E-Portfolio/blob/cc73dacffb3947b6eb01a0284c9254a5d4d23d7e/References/unit4%20initial%20post.pdf>Link to Initial Post</a></p></b


<u><b><p></p></b></u>
<u><b><p>Reflection</u></b></p>

<p>Unit 4 provided me with the chance to examine the tools and processes made accessible by Kali Linux in order to keep track of the vulnerabilities associated to the website that was provided to me (https://ehr-online.co.uk).

In my investigation, I focused primarily on the Log4j vulnerabilities and the effect that those issues had on a wide range of applications. An executive summary of the scan results was created by me after I had investigated the scripts and carried out testing on the website. On the online discussion forum, I weighed in on the subject of "the Pros and Cons of logging - the effect of log4j" with my thoughts. I also read the solution provided by the peer, and then I posted it.

I also finished the scanning operation and recorded all of the necessary information. A copy was uploaded to the online portfolio.

At the end of unit 4, I had a basic grasp of how a conventional breach attack is carried out, in addition to the various possibilities for limiting vulnerability assaults. This came as a result of the previous unit. At the end of unit 4, I had a strong grasp of how a conventional breach attack is carried out, in addition to the several options for limiting vulnerability attacks that are available.</p>

										<h2>Unit 5: Logging, Forensics and Future Trends</h2>
<p>We will discuss two topics key to breach investigation and resolution: logging and forensics. We will look at the differences between logging on Windows and Linux systems and review key tools used in logging. We will also review the types of investigation that can be carried out using common forensic tools.</p>

In this unit we shall:
Review logging tools and techniques on Windows and Linux.
Discuss best practice for the use of logging on both systems.
Investigate the use of forensic tools and the data that can be extracted.
On completion of this unit you will be able to:
Specify a logging configuration for Windows/Linux.
Select and utilise forensic tools.
Analyse the results of log and forensic analysis tools.</p>


<u><b><p>Reflection</u></b><p>
<p>Logging and forensics are extremely important aspects of investigating and fixing security breaches. I have an understanding of how Windows and Linux log data and collaborate with one another. We made use of several forensics tools. This lesson introduced us to Kali Linux and its various tools. Additionally, we investigated PurpleSec's example of a vulnerability report (Purplesec,N.D). Penetest and SIEM papers were reviewed by us. We gained knowledge on how to get a company ready for a SIEM audit and compliance architecture. (2021 Swift). We investigated network virtualization by utilising SDNs (SDN). Enterprise datacenters as well as public clouds may be modernised using SDN. SDN deployments using Cisco and VMware were carried out in client datacenters.</p>

										<h2>Unit 6: The Great Debate: The Future of the Internet</h2>

<p>This module bring together the various threads and lessons discussed in the module to answer the question: what is the future of the internet? In answering this question, you should consider technical and security considerations as well as social, legal and privacy challenges.</p>


<u><b><p>In this unit we shall:</u></b><p>
<p>Review how technological advances are trying to address the shortcomings of the current internet.
Discuss a number of alternative approaches to provide a next generation internet.
Investigate how these solutions mitigate technical, security, social, legal and privacy challenges.
On completion of this unit you will be able to:
Describe how a number of alternative next generation internet solutions will operate.
Explain how these solutions address key challenges.
Debate which potential should (or could) become the next generation internet.</p>
