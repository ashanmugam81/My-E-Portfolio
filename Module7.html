			<h2>Unit 4: Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations</h2>		
<u><b><p>In this unit we shall:</p></b></u>
<li>Introduce you to case studies, focus groups and observation methods.
<li>Discuss the advantage and drawbacks of these methods.
<li>Consider the types of data you will obtain.
<p>


<u><b><p>Case studies involve in-depth research and study of individuals or groups. Case studies lead to a hypothesis and widen a further scope of studying a phenomenon.</p></b></u>

However, case studies should not be used to determine cause and effect as they cannot make accurate predictions (due to possible bias on the researcher’s part). The other reason why case studies are not a reliable way of conducting descriptive research is that there could be an atypical respondent in the survey. Describing them leads to weak generalisations and a move away from external validity (see unit 7).
<p>

<u><b><p>A focus group</b></u> is also one of the commonly used qualitative research methods used in data collection. In such a method, a group of people is chosen and allowed to express their insights on the topic that is being studied.

It is important to make sure that when choosing the individuals for a focus group (limited to 6-10 people), they should have a common background, comparable experiences, and are representative of your target market. The main aim of the focus group is to find answers to the “why” “what” and “how” questions required to reach out to those individuals.

<u><b><p>Quantitative observation</b></u> refers observing numerical values such as weight, volume, shape, usually from a sample that represents the researcher’s target market/goal. So, there is an objective collection of data and then statistical and numerical analysis methods are applied to the data to obtain research results. Quantitative observation can be carried via experimentation or surveys (for example, customer satisfaction surveys).

<u><b><p>	Qualitative observation</b></u> refers to the monitoring of characteristics. In this case, the researcher observes the predetermined respondents from a distance. In this data gathering method, the respondents should be in a comfortable environment to help ensure that the characteristics observed are natural and effective. For example, a researcher in a supermarket can, from afar, monitor and track the customers’ selection and purchasing trends. This offers a more in-depth insight into the purchasing experience of the customer. In a descriptive research design, the researcher can choose to be either a complete observer, an observer as a participant, a participant as an observer, or a full participant.

<u><b><p>Feedback</p></b></u>

<u>Here are some suggestions to improve and “populate” it for the graded submission in Week 7.</u>
<li>Work on your research questions (RQs) narrowing them down as much as you can. Stated or not explicitly, a literature review is always about research questions and the way they have been treated /explored by others before you. The clearer and more focused RQs are, the better the LR.
<li>Remember that a LR is not just a collection of articles/sources. You need to construct a coherent narrative, and show you are able to offer critical analysis of them.
<li>The bulk of your references should be academic, supported by the appropriate industry/technical references. This depends a lot on the specific topic.
<li>The purpose of the conclusion is to wrap up your ideas/discussion and reinforce the key concepts expressed in the body of the LR. So, no original contributions are expected here, but you should highlight how the LR supports the research gaps you have identified when stating your research questions.

<h2>Unit 5: Interviews and Survey Methods</h2>		
<u><b><p>In this unit we shall:</p></b></u>
<li>Introduce you to interview methods and survey methods.
<li>Consider the definitions of population and sample.
<li>Introduce the concept of pre- and post-testing.
<p>

<u><b><p>On completion of this unit you will be able to:</p></b></u>
<li>Understand how interviews and surveys fit into research and whether either or both of these might be useful for your investigation.
<li>Understand how pre- and post-testing can be used in research.

<p>
<u><b><p>Reflective Activity 2: Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys</p></b></u>


<li>Cambridge Analytica obtained data from millions of Facebook users through a third-party app called "thisisyourdigitallife". The app was developed by Aleksandr Kogan, a Cambridge University psychologist. The app was designed to collect data about users' personalities and interests, and it did this by asking users to complete a series of surveys. The app also collected data about users' friends, even if those friends had not installed the app.

<li>Cambridge Analytica then used the data collected by thisisyourdigitallife to create psychographic profiles of millions of Facebook users. These profiles were then used to target users with personalized political advertisements during the 2016 US presidential election and the 2016 UK Brexit referendum.
<p>

<u><b><p>Why Cambridge Analytica used the data</p></b></u>

Cambridge Analytica used the data collected from Facebook users to target them with personalized political advertisements. The company claimed that its psychographic profiles could be used to predict how people would vote, and it used this information to target voters with ads that were designed to influence their vote.

Further examples of inappropriate use of surveys

<li>In 2016, a company called SurveyMonkey was fined by the Federal Trade Commission for selling data collected from its users to third-party advertisers without the users' consent.
<li>In 2017, a company called ResearchGate was fined by the German Federal Cartel Office for collecting and selling data about its users without their consent.
<li>In 2018, a company called AppNexus was fined by the UK Information Commissioner's Office for collecting and selling data about users without their consent.
<li>Impact of these examples from various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints

<u><b><p><u><b><p>Ethical:</b></u> The misuse of survey data raises a number of ethical concerns, including:</u></b>

<u><b><p>Informed consent:</b></u> Survey participants should be fully informed about how their data will be used before they consent to participate in a survey.
Privacy: Survey participants should have a reasonable expectation that their data will be kept private and not shared with third parties without their consent.
Autonomy: Survey participants should have the right to control how their data is used.
Social: The misuse of survey data can have a number of negative social impacts, including:

<u><b><p>Misinformation:</b></u> Misinformation can be spread through surveys that are poorly designed or that are used to collect data from biased samples.
Manipulation: Survey data can be used to manipulate people by targeting them with personalized messages that are designed to influence their beliefs or behaviors.
Discrimination: Survey data can be used to discriminate against people by targeting them with negative messages or by denying them access to opportunities.
Legal: The misuse of survey data can also violate a number of laws, including:

<u><b><p>Data protection laws:</b></u> Data protection laws in many countries give individuals the right to control how their personal data is collected and used.
Consumer protection laws: Consumer protection laws in many countries prohibit companies from misleading consumers or engaging in unfair practices.
Anti-discrimination laws: Anti-discrimination laws in many countries prohibit companies from discriminating against people on the basis of their race, religion, sex, or other protected characteristics.
Professional: Professional organizations for market researchers and survey designers have codes of ethics that prohibit the misuse of survey data. For example, the American Marketing Association's Code of Ethics states that marketers must "treat all participants with respect and dignity" and "obtain informed consent from participants before collecting or using their personal information."

<u><b><p>Conclusion</b></u>

The misuse of survey data is a serious problem that can have a number of negative ethical, social, legal, and professional consequences. It is important to be aware of this problem and to take steps to protect yourself from it. When you participate in a survey, be sure to read the terms of service carefully and only participate in surveys from reputable organizations. You should also be aware of the risks associated with sharing your personal information online.

<u><b><p>Research Proposal Outline</p></b></u>

The abstract provides an overview of the study topic titled " Securing the Wireless Networkarchitecture for an Airline industry that is resilient to denial-of-service attacks ". Thecomposition explores the implementation of security features, tools and methods, as well asthe several subjects covered in the article, including the introduction, methodology, literaturereview, findings, discussion, and conclusion.

<p>

<u><b><p>Feedback</p></b></u>

<u>Just a few points you want to keep in mind.</u>

<li>Your RQs / ROs need to be included and spelt out clearly and analytically. Make sure there is enough detail.

<li>The methodology section needs to provide sufficient information on the study design in terms of the kind of methods and justification for their choices.

<li>Another important point is that the proposal should include a section where you explain how the project meets the requirement of your M.Sc major --this should come at the beginning.

<li>Remember to pay attention to the visuals in your presentation --including charts and tables whenever possible.

<li>A Gantt Chart is also a good way to synthesise your planning in a neat and exhaustive way, and I advise including it in the presentation.
